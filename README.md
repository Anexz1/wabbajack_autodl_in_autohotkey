like the title states

works in autohotkey dash: https://www.autohotkey.com/

to use, download the file and put it in the same folder as two screenshots of the slow download button: one when its highlighted (with the mouse over it) and one when its just the normal gray one without the mouse over it

in theory the script brings the mouse back to the original positon so you should only need the image of the non-highlighted button but whatever i put both in to be safe

PRESS F8 TO RUN
PRESS F8 TO STOP THE SCRIPT 


This is how it should look <br> <br>

<br> Try to get the screenshot with only the buttons in it, none of the background
